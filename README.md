@James Minton @Uri Maxima A couple of requests for website:

* Where the scenarios are described in bullet points, can the orange scenario lettering (E+, E-, etc.) be on its own line, with the added words (High Electrification, Less-High Electrification, etc.) placed entirely in one line just below the lettering?

* In the data explorer, when "Pathway" mode is selected, can the scenario names (just above the data tables) be ordered left to right as REF, E+, E-, E-B+, E+RE-, E+RE+ ?

* When "Year" mode is selected, can the scenarios be shown left to right in the same order: REF, E+, E-, E-B+, E+RE-, E+RE+ ?  Also, in the word descriptions below the scenario names, please add a hyphenate "Less-high" (E- case) and replace "Business as usual" with "No new policies".

* The decimal place formatting looks good for the MACRO variables. I didn't check all, but I did notice that the Pillar 6 agriculture land sink values are showing 3 digits to right of decimal when in most cases the numbers are large and so there should be no digits to right of decimal.

* The explorer seems to have some trouble showing switching the data displayed when I apply a different category or sub-category filter. (I'm using Firefox for browser.)

* I'll be doing additional review in the next couple of days.
